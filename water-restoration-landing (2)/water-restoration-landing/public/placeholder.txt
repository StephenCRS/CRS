This is a placeholder file.

To add your logo to the website:
1. Upload your logo file (preferably in PNG format with transparent background)
2. Name it "logo.png" for the colored header version
3. Name it "logo-white.png" for the white footer version
4. Replace the placeholder logo in the Header.tsx and Footer.tsx components
5. Uncomment the Image component in both files

For best results, make sure your logo files are high resolution with proper transparency.
